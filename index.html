				<u><b>My Being to Your Place, Your Being to My Place: Co-present Robotic Avatars Create Illusion of Living Together</b></u> (MobiSys'18)
				<p>People in work-separated families have been heavily relying on cutting-edge face-to-face communication services. Despite their ease of use and ubiquitous availability, experiences in living together is still far incomparable to those through remote face-to-face communication. We envision that enabling a remote person to be spatially superposed in one's living space would be a breakthrough to catalyze pseudo living-together interactivity. We propose HomeMeld, a zero-hassle self-mobile robotic system serving as a co-present avatar to create a persistent illusion of living together for those who are involuntarily living apart. The key challenges are 1) continuous spatial mapping between two heterogeneous floor plans and 2) navigating the robotic avatar to reflect the other's presence in real time under the limited maneuverability of robot hardware. We devise a notion of functionally equivalent location and orientation to translate a person's presence into another in a heterogeneous floor plan. We also develop predictive path warping to seamlessly synchronize the moment-by-moment presence of the other. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate basic performance of HomeMeld, as well as a deployment study to qualitatively assess the system based on the participants' feedback.

				<u><b>Zaturi: We Put Together the 25th Hour for You. Create a Book for Your Baby</b></u> (CSCW'17)
				<p>We introduce Zaturi, a system enabling parents to create an audio book for their babies by utilizing micro spare time at working hours. We define micro spare time at work as tiny fragments of time with low cognitive loads that frequently occur at work, such as waiting for an elevator. We show that putting together micro spare time at work helps a working parent (1) build a tangible symbol conveying his/her mind to the beloved baby and (2) develop his/her own feeling of parental achievement, without compromising regular working hours. Zaturi lets the parent immediately be aware of micro spare time and provides a crafted interface to seamlessly record the book piece-by-piece, so that the baby can enjoy listening the book in the parent’s own voice. Through an extensive design process, we characterize the notion of micro spare time and build a working prototype of Zaturi. We report the parents’ perception and family reactions through two-week deployment.

                <u><b>BeUpright: Posture Correction Using Relational Norm Intervention</b></u> (CHI'16)
				<p>We propose the Relational Norm Intervention model, featuring passive participation of a paired helper with discomforting events when a user performs against the target behavior. We designed and implemented BeUpright, a mobile application for sitting posture correction, employing the Relational Norm Intervention model. We conducted a two-week study to evaluate the efficacy of BeUpright. The study showed that the Relational Norm Intervention model has the potential to have a greater effect in behavior change compared to conventional notification systems. The most influential factor for behavior change of the target users was wanting to avoid discomforting their helpers. The BeUpright application helped the pairs feel connected. The model also showed potentials to help individuals without motivation to change behavior.

                <u><b>Towards Understanding Relational Orientation: Attachment Theory and Facebook Activities</b></u> (CSCW'15)
                <p>We explore the possibility to develop a computational method to help understand the relational orientation of people. In recent social network research, there were several models to figure out individual personality, such as the Big Five or MBTI. These models focus on individual personal traits, although an online social network is a relational context and major activities in online social network involve interpersonal communication. Therefore, our study focused on attachment theory, a leading theory of interpersonal relationships. We crawled users’ Facebook data and surveyed attachment styles using a Facebook application, KnowYourself. We identified four features that significantly affect each attachment dimension, by exploring the two key relational processes (self-expression and responsiveness) on Facebook. We used regression analysis and found relationships between two attachment dimensions and Facebook activities.Carpool Network.
